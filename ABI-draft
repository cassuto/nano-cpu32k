Basic Data types:
	Word length = 32 bits
	size of:
		short = 16 bits
		int = 32 bits
		long = 32 bits
		long long = 64 bits
		float = 32 bits
		double = 64 bits
		long double = 64 bits
		void* = 32bits
	char is signed by default.
	
Registers:

0    1   2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11  12  13 14  ...
nil  lnk sp fp v0 v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 rv rvh tls    got 

2N = Callee-saved register
2N+1 = Caller-saved (Temporary for callee) register.

12 = TLS
14 = GOT

Stack:
	Stack grows Downward:
		pushing a word on the stack makes the stack pointer a smaller address.
		
	Frame grows Downward:
		the nominal address of the stack frame is at the
		high-address end of the local variables; that is, each additional local
		variable allocated goes at a more negative offset in the frame.

Machine:
	MAX page size = 0x2000 B

Relocations:
  BFD_RELOC_NCPU32K_REL_21            : 21bit PC-relative in instruction (REL21)

Thread Local Store (TLS):
	Four TLS modes:
		tgd: Global Dynamic model
		tld: Local Dynamic model
		tie: Initial Exec model
		tle: Local Exec model
