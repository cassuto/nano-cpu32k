      Number used as Shift Register:             0
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      6
      Number with same-slice register load:      6
      Number with same-slice carry load:         0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   4,556    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           46
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            19 out of      46   41%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      46    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          27 out of      46   58%
    Number of unique control sets:               4
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              15 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
