Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        24 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          136
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            52 out of     136   38%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of     136    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          79 out of     136   58%
    Number of unique control sets:               9
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              38 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
