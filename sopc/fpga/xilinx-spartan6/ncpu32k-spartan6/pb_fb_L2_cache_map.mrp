      Number using O5 output only:               8
      Number using O5 and O6:                   58
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                      60 out of   2,176    2%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:              0
      Number used as Single Port RAM:           60
        Number using O6 output only:            60
        Number using O5 output only:             0
        Number using O5 and O6:                  0
      Number used as Shift Register:             0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        44 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,552
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           916 out of   1,552   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  72 out of   1,552    4%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         564 out of   1,552   36%
    Number of unique control sets:              22
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              37 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       158 out of     186   84%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             19
