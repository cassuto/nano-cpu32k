Limitations for writing boot routines:
   1. Be aware we're running in ROM, don't declare and write any global variables (in .bss). The behavior is undefined.
      If one wants some global variables, allocate them in DRAM address space.
   2. Stack is growing from the highest address in the first 32MB space (located in DRAM)
   3. Available stack size is determined by macro `STACK_SIZE`.
   4. Code size is extremely limited.
